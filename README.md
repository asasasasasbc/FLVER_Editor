## Basic tutorial

1.Double click the MySFformat to start the program, choose the flver file you want to edit.
(Alternate way: drag the flver to the .exe file to auotmatic open the file, or you can set the flver file open method to this .exe file.)

2.You will see two windows. One is FLVER viewer and another is FLVER Bones.

[FLVER viewer]

A window to help you check the model and see the changes you made.

Basic operation:

	-Mouse press and move: rotate your camera
	
	-Mouse scroll: move forward/backward
	
	-Numpad 2 and 8: Move up/down your camera
	
	-F1: Render mode: line
	
	-F2: Render mode: mesh
	
	-F3: Render mode: both
	
	-F: Refresh the scene
	
	-Mouse Right click: check the clicked vertex information.
	
[FLVER Bones]

This is your main working bench. In this window you can edit some basic bone and header information.

Components in the left pannel: 

	-A list of bones and their basic information.
	
		Allowing you to edit bone names and their parent/child bone information.
		Need to click the  "Modify" button in the right panel to save your change.

	-Swap
		[Obsolete]Allowing you to swap mesh/material/bone information between two different flver file.
		It is used in some special or tricky cases and not very necessary. 
		But this is this program's first fuctionality, thus I kept it.
